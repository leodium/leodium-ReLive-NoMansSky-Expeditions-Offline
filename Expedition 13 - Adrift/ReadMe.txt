Lore
-----
Step into an empty universe, where you will find yourself surrounded by other Travellers… yet somehow still alone. The galaxy has been abandoned. There is no life to be seen anywhere – no aliens, no operational space stations, none of the usual network of shops and buildings.

Changes to the SEASON_DATA_CACHE.json file
------
EndTimeUTC value --> 2893423600 (so that it can still be done today)
Added the ability to activate shipping via the Nexus desktop
The Phase 4 become optional because the reward (the Ship of the Damned freighter) is broken. Claiming this reward will crash your game. Unlocking this reward will still unlock the Ship of the Damned freighter in the Quicksilver vendor, you just can't claim it on the expedition. To end the expedition you must replace the SEASON_DATA_CACHE.JSON with one from a different season, or restart the game in online mode.

Notes
------
Some expeditions start with tech in inventory slots. You need to move them.
If you need Polo to show you Atlas stations, he won't do it UNLESS you also ask him to show you black holes. Then you will see both on your galaxy map.
If you start your game in online mode after starting an offline expedition, your game will likely crash when you load it. Just close the game and go offline and everything should be fine.

Warning : The optional research milestones couldn't be done offline, so a patch was created to replace them with other milestones from previous expeditions.

Bug ?
---
1) The Phase 4 reward (Ship of the Damned frigate) cannot be claimed as it crashes your game when you try. Finishing all the other milestones in this Phase will unlock the Ship of the Damned on your account, so you can still claim it at the QuickSilver vendor. The expedition will work (and end) as normal apart from not being able to claim this reward.

How do you do it?
------------------
Simply copy/paste a file into a directory ... No modification/influence on saves !!! No intervention on game files ...

a) First of all, set your game software to "Offline".

b) Then, download the file "SEASON_DATA_CACHE.json" from the cache directory of the expedition you wish to redo.

c) Replace the file in your [cache] directory with the one you've just downloaded
-> Steam PC : %APPDATA%\HelloGames\NMS\cache
-> Steam Mac : ~/Library/Application Support/HelloGames/NMS/cache
-> MS Store/GOG : %APPDATA%\HelloGames\NMS\cache

d) Restart "No Man's Sky" in offline mode and start a new game "Expedition".
