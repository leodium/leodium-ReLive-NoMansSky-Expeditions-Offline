Lore
-----
Engage in a galactic bug hunt in No Man’s Sky’s fourteenth community expedition. A vile brood is spreading corruption across the universe – join the Liquidator Vanguard to do your part and purge the rot from the stars!
Report for duty alongside other Travellers to liquidate biological horrors and hosts of giant insects in a high-paced combat expedition full of custom-balanced swarm combat.
An exclusive selection of rewards await those that do their part in the war on bugs, including mounted bug trophies, new posters, and a complete set of organic armour parts forged from the bodies of the brood themselves.


Changes to the SEASON_DATA_CACHE.json file
------
EndTimeUTC value --> 2893423600 (so that it can still be done today)
Added the ability to activate shipping via the Nexus desktop

Notes
------
Some expeditions start with tech in inventory slots. You need to move them.
If you need Polo to show you Atlas stations, he won't do it UNLESS you also ask him to show you black holes. Then you will see both on your galaxy map.
If you start your game in online mode after starting an offline expedition, your game will likely crash when you load it. Just close the game and go offline and everything should be fine.
